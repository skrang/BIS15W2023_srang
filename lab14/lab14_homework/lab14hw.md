## Lab 14 Binder
If you want to return to the binder, find the [repository and instructions here](https://github.com/hehouts/lab14_binder)

## Instructions
Answer the following questions in RMarkdown. Please embed all of your code and push your final work to your repository. Be sure to add your name to the author header above.



## Questions

1. Look up 'Data Scientist' at https://www.bls.gov/. What degree is required for this career? Is it a growing occupation?  

```r
#bachelors degree and it is a growing occupation
```


2. How would you describe your data science skills on a resume for a job application? Write a blurb that reflects the skills you have learned in this course. 

```r
#can analyze dataset by pulling out information, rearranging the data to view trends, create graphs to visually see those trends
```


3. What are your current career interests, and how could your R skills support that career path? (hint: this might be good content for your LinkedIn profile ;)

```r
#career interests would to be working in a lab or something research, biology, related 
#this class gave a foundation to if i were to use R in analyzing data
```


4. What about this course has been the most difficult for you? What has been the most rewarding?

```r
#most difficult would be remembering commands and what they do exactly because not all the time i get the rresult i would aim for. most rewarding is finally getting it and if the code was efficient
```


5. What do you wish you had known, or what skills do you wish you had, before taking this class.

```r
#i think this class requires no background knowledge of R or coding because i am new to it. it was very much an introductory course which i appreciate because i was always interested but intimidated by it. a skill i wish i had for this course would be typing faster, not content related.
```


6. If we had 1 more lab in this class, what would you have liked to learn more about?

```r
#diving more into apps
```


7. Now that you have (almost!) completed this course, do you plan to persue further data or computer science skills? What do you plan to do?

```r
#i would love to pursue data science further but currently i do not have a plan or do not know how to build onto these skills
```


8. How important was working with a partner to your success in this class? If this class were transitioned to an online format, how do you think that would affect your understanding?

```r
#working with a partner in person was very helpful because we are there in person; easy to introduce each other, communicate, share screen/code, ask a question etc. if this class was online, i think i would have had more trouble following along, not talk as much, and my laptop would not be able to handle zoom and R studio at the same time.
```


9. Did you complete the class evaluation? Please complete the class evaluation using the link provided in the announcements. Your feedback is very important and we appreciate your time.

```r
#yes
```
